# Machine Learning Models Implementation

This repository includes implementations of various machine learning models used for classification, regression, time series forecasting, and clustering. The following algorithms are demonstrated:

- **Decision Trees** (Classification)
- **Logistic Regression** (Classification)
- **Linear Regression**
- **ARIMA** (Time Series Forecasting)
- **K-means** (Clustering)
- **LightGBM** (Classification)

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of different machine learning algorithms for solving various types of problems:

- **Classification**: Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, LightGBM.
- **Regression**: Linear Regression.
- **Time Series**: ARIMA.
- **Clustering**: K-means.

The code is structured to cover key tasks such as training models, making predictions, and evaluating the performance using appropriate metrics. It also includes visualizations for better understanding of results.

## Features

- Implementations for classification, regression, time series, and clustering algorithms.
- Use of popular libraries: `sklearn`, `statsmodels`, `lightgbm`.
- Sample datasets such as the Iris dataset and custom-generated data.
- Visualizations for regression and clustering results.

## Requirements

To run the notebooks, you'll need the following libraries:

- `scikit-learn`
- `statsmodels`
- `lightgbm`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
